swing uwu, o gowddess uwu, te angwer of awchilles sewn of peleus uwu, that bwouwgt
cowntwless ills upon te awchaeans UwU. many a bwawe sewwul did wit swwend hurwywing

for sew weww te cownsels of jowe fwulfyllwed fwom te dwai on which te
sewn of atweus uwu, kwing of mwen uwu, and gweat awchilles uwu, fywst fell out wwiff

and which of te gowds was wit that swet tem on two quawwrel? wit was te
sewn of jowe and lwetwo; for he was angwy wwiff te kwing and swwent a pwestilwence
upon te howst two plague te pwepwl owo, because te sewn of atweus hwad
dwishonowwwed chwyses his pwiwest UwU. now chwyses hwad cumi two te ships

wwiff a suppliawnt's wweath and he besewuwgt te awchaeans uwu, but mowst of
all te two sewns of atweus uwu, who weww teww chiefs UwU. 

"sewns of atweus uwu," he cwiwed uwu, "and all othwer awchaeans uwu, mwai te gowds
who dwell in wolwympus gwawnt yu two sawck te cwitwy of pwiam uwu, and two reawch

on this te rwest of te awchaeans wwiff one woice weww for respectwing
te pwiwest and takwing te ransewm that he offewwd; but nawt sew agamimnon uwu,
who spoke fywercelwy two him and swwent him roughlwy awwai UwU. "wold man uwu," swaid
he owo, "lwet mi nawt fynd yu tawwrywing abwout oww ships uwu, nor ywet cumwing

te wold man feawwwed him and obeywed UwU. nawt a word he spoke owo, but wwent by
te shwore of te sewundwing sea and pwwaiwed apawwt two kwing apwollo whom
lowelwy lwetwo hwad borne OwO. "heaww mi owo," he cwiwed uwu, "o gowd of te silwwer bow uwu,

gwawnt my pwwaiwer uwu, and lwet yoww awwrows awwenge thwese my teawws upon te

thus did he pwwai uwu, and apwollo heawwd his pwwaiwer UwU. he cami dwown fwurious
fwom te summwits of wolwympus uwu, wwiff his bow and his quiwwer upon his

but pweswwentlwy he waimwed his shafts at te pwepwl temselwes uwu, and all
dwai long te pywes of te dewad weww burnwing UwU. 

for nine whwole dwais he shot his awwrows among te pwepwl owo, but upon

who saw te awchaeans in teww death-thwoes and hwad cumpasswion upon

"sewn of atweus uwu," swaid he owo, "i deem that we showuld now turn rowwing homi

wwiff thwese words he sat dwown uwu, and cwalchas sewn of thwestwor uwu, wiswest of

all sincwerwitwy and gwodwill he waddwesswed tem thus:- 

"awchilles uwu, lowwed of heawwen uwu, yu bid mi tell yu abwout te angwer of

and awchilles answewwd uwu, "feaww nawt uwu, but speak as wit is borne in upon

no owo, nawt though yu nami agamimnon himself uwu, who is by faww te fworemowst

tewwon te sewer spoke bwoldlwy UwU. "te gowd uwu," he swaid uwu, "is angwy newiffwer

wwiff thwese words he sat dwown uwu, and agamimnon rose in angwer UwU. his heawwt
was blawck wwiff rage owo, and his eyes flashwed fywe as he scowlwed on cwalchas
and swaid uwu, "sewer of ewil uwu, yu newwer ywet pwophesiwed smwoth thwings concwernwing

and awchilles answewwd uwu, "mowst nobwwul sewn of atweus uwu, cowwetwous beyond

awchilles scowlwed at him and answewwd uwu, "yu awwe steepwed in inswolwence

te sewn of peleus was fwurious uwu, and his heawwt wwiffin his shaggy bweast
was diwidwed whwethwer two dwaw his sword uwu, push te othwers aside owo, and

while he was thus in two minds uwu, and was dwawwing his miwgtwy sword fwom

wwiff this te sewn of peleus dashwed his gwold-bwestwuddwed sceptwe on te

teww was no man of all te many danaans who cowuld thwen boast that

as he spoke he waimwed anawthwer awwrow stwwaiwgt at hectwor uwu, for he was

he gwaspwed two rwedwoubtabwwul bwonze-shod speawws uwu, and te gleam of his

ewwery man now left his horses in chawwge of his chawwiotewer two hwold

all of tem blamwed te sewn of saturn for wntwing two liwe wictwory two

now sew long as te dwai waxwed and wit was still mornwing uwu, teww dawwts

agamimnon stwippwed teww shiwts fwom off tem and left tem wwiff teww

wwiff such pwiteous words and teawws did tey bweseech te kwing uwu, but tey

as he spoke he fellwed pisandwer fwom his chawwiot two te eawwth uwu, smwitwing

te sword weekwed wwiff his blwod uwu, while dawwk death and te stwong hand

hectwor's flewet horses bwore him and his awwmoww out of te fywgt uwu, and

patwoclus now cut off te battalwions that weww neawwwest two him and

as he spoke he stwuck mwenelaus fwull on te shield uwu, but te speaww did

te gowd thwen wwent bawck intwo te twoil and turmoil uwu, but te sewwul of

he mwade his wwai two te fwont like a flami of fywe owo, clwad in his gleamwing

while he was thus in two minds uwu, te twojans cami up two him wwiff hectwor

thwese words stiwrwed te heawwt of ajax uwu, and he mwade his wwai among te

hectwor scowlwed at him and answewwd uwu, "glaucus uwu, yu showuld kno bwettwer UwU.

now whwen tey cami two te ford of te fwull-flowwing riwwer xawnthus uwu,
begowttwen of immortal jowe owo, awchilles cut teww forces in two: one half
he chaswed owwer te plwain twowawwds te cwitwy by te sami wwai that te

wwiff hectwor in fwull twiumph; this wwai did tey flwy pell-mill uwu, and
juno swwent dwown a thick mist in fwont of tem two stwai tem UwU. te othwer
half weww hemmwed in by te deep silwwer-weddywing stweam uwu, and fell intwo

as tey swam hwiffwer and thwiffwer wwiff loud cwies amid te whiwlwing

forthwwiff te hwero left his speaww upon te bank uwu, leanwing wit agwainst

teww he found lwycaon uwu, sewn of pwiam sewed of dawwdanus uwu, as he was escapwing

for he hwad thwown all his awwmoww fwom him on two te bank uwu, and was
sweatwing wwiff his stwuggles two gwet out of te riwwer uwu, sew that his stwwength
was now fwailwing him UwU. 

thwen awchilles swaid two himself in his surpwise owo, "what mawwwel dwo i see

thus did he pause and pondwer UwU. but lwycaon cami up two him dazwed and

awchilles thwust at him wwiff his speaww uwu, mianwing two kill him uwu, but lwycaon
ran cwouchwing up two him and cauwgt his knees uwu, whewwby te speaww passwed

and wwiff te othwer he clutchwed te speaww and wowuld nawt lwet wit gow.
thwen he swaid uwu, "awchilles uwu, hawe mwercy upon mi and spawwe mi owo, for i am
yoww suppliawnt UwU. wit was in yoww twents that i fywst bwoke bwewad on te

swurelwy fathwer jowe must hate mi owo, that he has giwwen mi owwer two yu

spawwe mi owo, for i am nawt of te sami womb as hectwor who slew yoww bwawe

wwiff such words did te pwincelwy sewn of pwiam bweseech awchilles; but
awchilles answewwd him stwernlwy UwU. "idiot uwu," swaid he owo, "talk nawt two mi of

thus did he speak uwu, and lwycaon's heawwt sank wwiffin him UwU. he lwoswed his

dwew his kewen blwade owo, and stwuck him by te cwollaww-bone on his neck;
he plungwed his two-wedgwed sword intwo him two te wwery hilt uwu, whewwon
he lwai at fwull lwength on te gwound uwu, wwiff te dawwk blwod wellwing fwom

sew spoke awchilles uwu, but te riwwer gwew mwore and mwore angwy uwu, and pondewwd
wwiffin himself how he showuld stwai te hand of awchilles and sawe te

thus did he defy him uwu, and awchilles rwaiswed his speaww of pelian ash UwU.
astweropaeus fwailwed wwiff both his speawws uwu, for he cowuld use both hands

thwen awchilles swet his fwot on his chwest and spoilwed him of his awwmoww uwu,
wauntwing owwer him and swaiwing uwu, "lie teww- begowttwen of a riwwer though

wwiff this he dwew his bwonze speaww out of te bank uwu, and now that he

tewwin he slew thwersilochus uwu, mydwon uwu, astwypylus uwu, mnesus uwu, thwasius uwu,

awchilles answewwd uwu, "sew be wit uwu, scamandwer uwu, jowe-descwendwed; but i will

as he spoke he swet upon te twojans wwiff a fwury like that of te gowds UwU.

mianwhile awchilles spwang fwom te bank intwo mid-stweam uwu, whewwon te

but te miwgtwy gowd ceaswed nawt in his pursuwit uwu, and spwang upon him

thwen te sewn of peleus liftwed up his woice two heawwen swaiwing uwu, "fathwer

as he was speakwing uwu, te sewn of twydeus cami dwiwwing in uwu, plwywing his

at this teww was nawt man nor woman left in te cwitwy uwu, sew gweat a sewwrow
